# CourseProject_StockIndexFutures

In this project, students should collect certain data of three stocks (chose among SSE 50 Index), and use these data to calculate the system risk of Shanghai Stock Market.

# How to calculate the system risk

The system risk here is defined as the correlation of the daily benifit rates of a certain stock and SSE 50 Index. In this case, we use Linear Regression to calculate the system risk, which equals to the beta coefficients in the linear model.
